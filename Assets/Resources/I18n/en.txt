tuto1_1=So, I’ve heard you want to be a Hero, too! I’m very proud of you, but you need to be prepared, for this path will be long and difficult.
tuto1_2=First of all, you’ll need to learn how to… run! Go to the blue square over there by clicking the pink ones around you. I’ll wait you there!

tuto2_1=Ha, we meet again! I knew you’ll manage! Unfortunately, the path is crowded here. We’ll need a new kind of move… Lucky of you! You have your friends to help you through this adventure! 
tuto2_2=I’m sure one of them will know how to solve the situation. Go to the blue square and give her the next turn.

tuto2_3=What a fierce girl! Nice to meet you! Can you help us? Jump over that hole by using your knight’s “L” move, and go to the next blue square.

tuto2_4=Well done! You must have noticed that a line just appeared above your head. It tells which one of you will play the next turns. \nBe sure to read it in order to prepare your future moves ahead.
tuto2_5=There are four of you, you can practice here in this safe Zone. Join me on the other side of the purple line when you feel ready.

tuto3_1=I hope you had fun back there! Things are going to be way more serious. \nIn real conditions, the stage will fall down behind you : you HAVE TO keep moving in order to survive. 
tuto3_2=But between those two special lines, time will freeze and you can cool down the fever here. My pro tip : take this time to prepare your next turns by using all the information you can have! \nNow, go to the blue square a little further.

tuto4_1=Look over there! Big Bad Guys!! If you don’t pay attention, they will attack you! I wrote you down the positions you don’t want to be. 
tuto4_2=Approach your enemies and jump on them when you find an opportunity! Meet me again at the next blue square.

tuto5_1=Hahaha! I knew you had it in you! You will be great Heroes! But as you know, the outside world is full of danger and you need protection... 
tuto5_2=Hey, look just here : a Shield! It’s a strong ally in combat. Take it and walk in front of that enemy : let the shield protect you from his attack, then hit him back!
tuto5_3=I’ll be waiting for you over there.

tuto6_1=Congratulations! You nailed it! You are now officially true Heroes! \nWait a second… Is the stage’s already falling?? quick, run fast before it catches you up!!
tuto6_2=We’ll meet again, fellow Heroes! You can do it!
